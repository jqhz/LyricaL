## History

LyricaL was first created in December 2024, having its [prototype](https://github.com/jqhz/LyricaL-py) built in Python using a Tkinter window with similar threading and asynchronous functions for similar behavior. This implementation took it one-step further with Java Swing components to improve everything from looks to functionality.
